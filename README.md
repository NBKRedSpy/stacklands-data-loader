# stacklands-data-loader
Mod to download card data from stacklands.

This is a fork of YuriDLL's excellent stacklands-data-loader ( https://github.com/YuriDLL/stacklands-data-loader )

# Fork Differences
This version changes the YAML export to use an object layout instead of a Key/Value pair.
The change makes automated data import into other programs easier.

The output is significantly different from the source project's output and is not compatible.
